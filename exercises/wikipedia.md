# Random Wikipedia walker

Using Selenium, create a small program that, starting from the main page https://www.wikipedia.org/, walks trough a sequence of random links and takes a snapshot of the last page.
The process is as follows:

 1. Navigate to the main page https://www.wikipedia.org/
 2. Select a random link in the page
 3. Navigate to the link
 4. Repeat steps 2 to 3 until you have visited 10 different pages
 5. Take a snapshot of the current page and save it

Include the code of the walker and the snapshot in this document.

## Answer

from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.common.keys import Keys

```
